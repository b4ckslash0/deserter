<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<!---[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)-->

`deserter` is a *targeted* DNS cache poisoner. It is capable of DNS cache poisoning *without* bruteforcing the target ID and source port - instead, it sniffs out DNS probes and uses the information inside to craft poisoned responses and send them back to the target.

In the absence of DNS security mechanisms, `deserter` has a near 100% success rate of poisoning the target's cache when the router has to forward the DNS query to an external DNS server (the router doesn't have an entry for the domain in its own cache).

### Highlights
- Silence - `deserter` doesn't flood the network with any type of packet - it only ever sends a single response per query received.
- Speed - `deserter` is fast which is required when racing against packets coming from the legitimate name server.
- Robustness & Easy of Use - `deserter` supports DNS/MDNS queries of type A/AAAA as well as DNS over IPv6, all while being extremely simple to use.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

In order for the tool to work, the attacker needs to be on the same network as the victim. Sometimes, *arp spoofing* may also be required - usually on physical connections through Ethernet.

### Building from source

1. Clone the repo with its submodules 
```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/cr0mll/deserter
```

2. Install libpcap
```bash
sudo apt-get install libpcap-dev
```

3. Change into `deserter/scripts`
```bash
cd deserter/scripts
```

4. Change the permissions for the scripts and run it
```bash
chmod +x *
```
Run the installation script:
```bash
./install.sh
```

This will configure and build the binary in the `deserter/build` directory.

You can use the scripts `configure.sh` and `build.sh` to manually configure and build the cmake project.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

The tool requires sudo permissions to be run.
You can run deserter with `--help` to get information about all of the available options.

### Performing a DNS cache poisoning
For any DNS cache poisoning attack, you will need to specify the network interface which `deserter` should use and the IPv4 address which to use for poisoning queries:
```bash
./deserter -b <bad IP> -i <interface>
```

#### Specifying targets to poison
The `-t`/`--targets` options can be used to provide a comma-separated list, without whitespace, of IPv4/IPv6 addresses whose queries to poison. By default, `deserter` will poison all queries it sees. Furthermore, you can prepend `~` to any IP addresses you want to *exclude* from the target list, such that their queries are left unaltered.

#### Specifying domains to poison
The `-d`/`--domains` options can be used to provide comma-separated list, without whitespace, of the domains which to poison when they are found in a query. By default, `deserter` will poison all domains.
